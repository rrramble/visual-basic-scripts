# Simple scripts on Microsoft Visual Basic

## Save the phonebook as HTML file

[Exports XLSM-phonebook](./phonebook.vbs) from Microsoft Excel to HTML.
When exporting, it adds QR codes for all contacts, which one can scan with their smartphone.

The script relies on an external service [qrserver.com](https://api.qrserver.com) to encode contact with QR.
Therefore, use this script at your risk if your contacts are not to be disclosed.
